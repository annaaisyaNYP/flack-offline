          Regulated E-Waste can be broken down into 2 categories - Consumer and

          For Non-Regulated E-Waste, do check if the E-Waste is still in working
          condition. If yes, we would recommend for you to send it for any
          necessary repair or refurbishment before continuing to use it until the
          end of the product life cycle. If the E-Waste cannot be utilised
          anymore, you can bring it down to ALBA WH’s Cash-for-Trash (CFT)
          stations deployed in the
          <span class="other-link" style="font-size: unset">

          </span>
          . Alternatively, you can search online for the nearest CFT stations to
          you and check in with your Public Waste Collector to see if they accept
          regulated E-Waste.

          <br /><br />
          Not all non-regulated E-Waste are collected at CFTs, for e.g. CDs, DVDs,
          cassettes, electric tooth brush and charger, etc. are not collected at
          CFTs. Please check with your respective Public Waste Collector to see

          We recommend for the public to erase all their data on their data

          ALBA E-Waste ensures that the E-Waste will be collected, sorted and
          transported to qualified recyclers. These recyclers have been audited
          and have specific data sanitisation mechanisms put in place when
          processing the E-Waste.

          <br /><br />All data especially for HDDs are cleared/deleted through a
          degaussing equipment and later sent for crushing/shredding. During
          degaussing, the hard drive is rendered inoperable and cannot be reused.
          As for SSDs, they are sent for puncturing for data destruction. The
          recycler will maintain records of all data sanitisation processes which
          are subject to audit.
